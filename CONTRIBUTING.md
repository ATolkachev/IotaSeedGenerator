Hello My friends !

Fell free to make any contribution you want to do in this repo.

The objective here is to create a simple Iota Seed Generator.

The program is written in C, but you could help me write it in java, python, C++, C#, and other languages that you a familiar too.

The C file is in the master branch.

Attentio:  There is some rules to make an Iota Seed , so I sugest you could read this explanation :

1- The SEED must only have uppercase letters and the number 9
2- The SEED must have a size between 30 to 81 included.
